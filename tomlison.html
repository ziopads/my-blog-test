  <p>Roger Tomlison was a geographer who had many different job titles and he was a successful worker in all of those different work areas. Roger Tomlison was orignally from the United Kingdom and served in the military for the UK, but after his services he moved to Canada and worked for the Candian goverment. When he was in Canada he was working as a photo interpreter, but was asked to create a methodology in order to find a tree plantation spot for the Candian goverment in Kenya. Roger failed at his first attempt, so he used technology to find a solution. Roger's GIS (geography information system) solution helped the Candian goverment save money. Doctor Roger Tomlison didn't stop there, but continued to do greater thinks when he became part of the International Geograaphical Union's and the president of Canadian Association of Geographers.
